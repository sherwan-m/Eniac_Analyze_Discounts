# Eniac_Analyze_Discounts
The company has high hopes put into the possibilities that come with Data Analysis, and they are especially hopeful that your work can finally settle an ongoing debate: whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products.

* The Marketing Team Lead is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allow the company to grow.
* The main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the company’s recent quarterly results showed an increase in number of orders, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.

## aspects:
* How products should be classified into different categories in order to simplify reports and analysis.
* What is the distribution of product prices across different categories.
* How many products are being discounted.
* How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices.
* How seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales.
* How could data collection be improved.

Before you get too deep into the business questions, there are some bad news we need to share with you: the data appears to have some inconsistencies —it must have been corrupted. The Database Administrator, Khader, blames the buggy pipeline that connects the online store with the database, while the Software Engineer, Lina, claims the issues have to do with wrong encodings and bad maintenance practices in our database. As Khader and Lina argue with one another and try to fix the data source, the company board does not have time to lose: they want your business insights.

In short, you will have a lot of data cleaning to do before you can even start to think about the business questions.
